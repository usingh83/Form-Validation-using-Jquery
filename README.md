# Form-Validation-using-Jquery

Your html page will include three textboxes for username, password and phone number of the user and one “Validate” button. When the user clicks on the button, you will validate the user input by using JQuery.

Validation rules: 
All fields are mandatory.
Username and password should be at least 6 characters.
Phone number should include only numbers.

If user input is valid, create a new paragraph at the end of the page and show the success message.The text color for the success message will be green.

If it is not valid, create a new paragraph and show all errors. The text color for the error messages will be red.

Write unobtrusive script code for attaching event handlers to the events and also for changing style properties of elements (css properties should be defined as css classes and you should change the class of the paragraph from JQuery).
